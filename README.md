# 🎵 Sangeet – Spotify Clone Project

A Spotify-inspired web music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to simulate core music streaming functionalities like album browsing, song playback, and audio controls.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a frontend-based music player that dynamically loads albums and songs from a folder structure. It provides an interactive UI similar to Spotify, including playback controls, seek bar, volume control, and responsive design for mobile devices.

The application uses the JavaScript Audio API to manage music playback and DOM manipulation for dynamic content rendering.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Core Logic)

1. Album Loading
  * Fetches folder data using fetch()
  * Extracts <a> tags from server response
  * Loads album metadata (info.json)
    
2. Song Loading
  * Reads .mp3 files from selected folder
  * Stores songs in an array (songs[])
  * Dynamically renders song list
   
3. Audio Playback
  * Uses:
    ** new Audio() → creates audio object
    ** currentSong.src → sets track
    ** currentSong.play() → plays music
     
4. Seek Bar Logic
5. Volume Control
